      Welcome, and thank you for visiting my page!
      I’m a researcher in macroeconomics at the CBM, with a focus on the transmission and propagation of macroeconomic shocks throughout the economy.
      In particular, I’m interested in how these shocks affect income and wealth inequality. My work is primarily empirical.
      I’m currently expanding my methodological toolkit to include forecasting techniques and functional data analysis. I have a strong interest in
      distributional dynamics and Bayesian multivariate time series modelling.
