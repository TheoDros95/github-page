# About Me

Hi! My name is Theodossios Drossidis (just Theo is fine). I am currently working as a Research Economist in the Research Department of the Central Bank of Malta. My work focuses on macroeconomic forecasting and structural analysis, with a particular interest in understanding how macroeconomic shocks impact the economy.

## Background
I began my academic journey at the University of Siegen in Germany, where I studied Business Administration. Early in my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in macroeconomics, which led me to pursue a Master of Science in Economics at the University of Düsseldorf, specialising in monetary economics.

Most recently, I completed my PhD in Economics at Brunel University London in the UK. I was supervised by [Dr Angeliki Theophilopoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/angelikitheophilopoulou/home), who played a key role in shaping my research interests. Under her guidance, I focused on the distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks, with particular attention to household heterogeneity and Bayesian econometrics.

## Interests

When it comes to research, I am passionate about empirical macroeconometrics, particularly the distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks. I also enjoy working on forecasting exercises and am continuously motivated to explore new methodologies and research questions that challenge conventional perspectives.

Outside of work, I value staying active and connected. I enjoy spending time with friends, going to the gym, playing the guitar, and riding my motorcycle. For nearly 20 years, I was an active football player — a passion that shaped my appreciation for teamwork and discipline. However, the competitive days are over!

Feel free to connect or reach out!
