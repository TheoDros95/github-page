### üîπ The distributional effects of oil supply news shocks 
<small> with [Haroon Mumtaz](https://sites.google.com/site/hmumtaz77/) and [Angeliki Theophilopoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/angelikitheophilopoulou/home) </small>
This paper uses high-frequency data on the distribution of US income to investigate the heterogeneous effects of oil supply news shocks. Using a FAVAR with an external instrument, we show that these shocks have large negative effects on the left and right tail of the distribution. For low-income individuals, the effect is driven by a decline in wages and proprietors‚Äô income, while a fall in corporate profits and interest income drives the effect for affluent individuals.
