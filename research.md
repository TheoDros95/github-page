This paper uses high-frequency data on the distribution of US income to investigate the heterogeneous effects of oil supply news shocks. Using a FAVAR with an external instrument, we show that these shocks have large negative effects on the left and right tail of the distribution. For low-income individuals, the effect is driven by a decline in wages and proprietors’ income, while a fall in corporate profits and interest income drives the effect for affluent individuals.
